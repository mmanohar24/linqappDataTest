Linq Data Candidate Take-Home Test

Problem Statement
In an event-driven system, a worker service processes real-time events from Kafka, performing important calculations. However, an error occurred, causing some events to be missed or processed incorrectly. The problem is that we don't have a traditional database to store historical event data, so we need a way to recover and recalculate the results accurately.

Assumptions
1. The system is based on Kafka or a similar message queue.
2. Each event has a timestamp and a unique identifier.
3. The worker service follows an at-least one processing model, which reduces the chances of data loss.
4. The error may have been caused by failures during processing or missing messages.

High-Level Solution
To solve this, I need to:
1. Identify the events that were either missed or processed incorrectly.
2. User Kafka's built in replay mechanisms to retrive historical events.
3. Reset the customer offsets to reprocess these missed events.
4. Recalculate the results, ensuring accuracy by deduplicating and verifying the final outcomes.


Recovery & Recalculation
1. Missed Events: By restting the Kafka consumer offset, I can replay events starting from a previous timestamp, ensuring I dont' miss anything.
2. Incorrectly Processed Events: If there were calculation errors, I can reprocess the original events and apply the neccessary corrections.
3. Deduplication: To prevent processing the same event multiple times, I need to ensure that the system is idempotent - meaning it processes the same event only once, no matter how many times it's triggered.

Tools & Strategies (Kafka + Consumer Offset Reset)
1. Kafka Retention & Replay: Kafka retains events for a specified period, allowing me to replay past events that were missed or incorrectly processed.
2. Consumer Offset Reset: By resetting the consumer group's offset, I can instruct Kafka to start reading from a specific point, which helps recover lost or wrongly processed data.
3. Idempotency & Checkpointing: To maintain accuracy and avoid unneccessary reprocessing, I'll tract events I've already handled and save the offsets of successfully processed events.

Ensuring Accuracy & Consistency
1. Logging & Monitoring: It's crucial to monitor reprocessed events and check if the recalculations are consistent.
2. Checkpointing: By saving the offsets of processed events, I can avoid reprocessing events multiple times.
3. Cross-Validation: After recalculating the results, I will compare them with the expected outputs to make sure everything adds up.

Code Snippet (Automating with Kafka)
To recover and recalculate the missed or incorrect data, I have implemented the following solution:
1.	Resetting the consumer offset: This allows us to reprocess the missed events.
2.	Handling recalculations for incorrect events: If events were processed incorrectly, we can apply the necessary corrections.
3.	Ensuring deduplication: This prevents reprocessing of events that have already been handled.

This script will reset the consumer group’s offset, instructing it to reprocess past events. While Kafka also offers command-line tools like kafka-consumer-groups.sh --reset-offsets for manual resets, the code in event_reprocessor.py automates the entire process.

Summary & Justification

Why This Approach?
Resetting the consumer offset and leveraging Kafka’s built-in replay feature seems like the most efficient solution. It allows me to make use of existing infrastructure and doesn’t require additional storage, which is ideal in many cases. By resetting the offsets, I ensure that any missed or incorrectly processed events are handled without needing to store large amounts of additional data.

Trade-offs
One of the main drawbacks of this approach is that it relies heavily on Kafka’s retention settings. If the retention period has passed and the events are no longer available, this solution won’t work. In that case, we would need a different strategy, like using an external storage system, to handle events that are no longer in Kafka.

Alternative Approaches
1. Log-Based Storage: We could track events using logs or a different storage system. This would make it easier to access past events, but it could add complexity and storage overhead.
2. Audit Database: We could implement an audit database to store each event and its results, which would make recovery easier. However, this introduces extra costs and maintenance for the database.

What If We Had More Tools?
If we had access to an external database or logs, we could query and recompute missing or incorrect data more directly, without relying on Kafka’s retention.

Scalability Considerations
To ensure scalability when processing millions of events per hour, I can:
1. Use multiple consumer groups and scale horizontally by adding more consumers as needed.
2. Process events in batches to reduce overhead and improve throughput.
3. Fine-tune Kafka’s offset control to reprocess only relevant events.
4. Continuously monitor system performance and auto-scale resources during peak loads.

These strategies will help me maintain performance while handling large event volumes efficiently.
